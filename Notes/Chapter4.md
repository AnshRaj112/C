# Chapter 4: Operators

An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform a specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce a final result.

## Section 4.1: Relational Operators

Relational operators check if a specific relation between two operands is true. The result is evaluated to 1 (which means *true*) or 0 (which means *false*). 

**Equals "=="**
